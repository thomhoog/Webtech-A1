                        The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and released in 1993 as HTML 1.0. Its functions included the control of basic elements such as text or images. 
                        The goal was to be able share information that is readable and accessible on different web browsers. 
                        Despite HTML 1.0 offering new features, it lacked many basic styling features. Tables and fonts, for example, had not yet been included as tags. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1995, HTML 2.0 resolved this problem. For the first time additional features to HTML 1.0 were released, including new form and table tags. 
                        This version of HTML remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997. 
                        At the same time the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was formed to ensure a standard for all web browsers and to help maintain the standard across different web browsers. 
                        Therefore, HTML tags were able to be equality across different browsers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following this, the HTML 3.2 version was released. 
                        It included more powerful characteristics for webmasters designing web pages. 
                        Additionally, HTML 3.2 allowed CSS to style the individual HTML elements, allowing more freedom and creativity for web design. 
                        Including these new features in HTML, however, slowed down the browsers calling for the improvemnet of the current version.

                        In 1999 a new version of HTML was published. HTML 4.01 was extended to support CSS and offered more tags. 
                        This version remained the most current one until 2014 when HTML 5.0 was released. It is currently the latest version of HTML.
