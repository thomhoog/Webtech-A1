                        <strong>Hypertext</strong> is text displayed on a
                        computer display or other electronic devices with
                        references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader
                        can immediately access.<a href="#ref-one"><sup>1</sup></a>
                        A <strong>markup language</strong> is a computer language
                        that uses tags to define elements
                        within a document.<a href="#ref-two"><sup>2</sup></a>
                        When the document is processed for display, the markup
                        language is not shown, and is only
                        used to format the text.<a href="#ref-three"><sup>3</sup></a>

                        <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, otherwise
                        known as <b>HTML</b>, is a markup language used to create
                        the content structure of web pages and web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML is <em>not</em> a programming language, meaning
                        it doesnâ€™t have the ability to create dynamic
                        functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to
                        organize and format documents, similarly to 
                        Microsoft Word. HTML allows you to create
                        and structure sections, paragraphs, headings,
                        et cetera. You can view these documents using any
                        web browser, such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla
                        Firefox. The browser reads the HTML file and renders
                        its content so that internet
                        users can view it.<a href="#ref-four"><sup>4</sup></a>

                    <p>
                        The standards and practices for writing HTML are set
                        by the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong>
                        (<b>W3C</b>), who constantly publish new versions and updates
                        of HTML.<a href="#ref-five"><sup>5</sup></a>
                        The first ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 invented
                        by Tim Berners-lee from the CERN research institute,
                        but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1999.

                    <p>
                        All HTML pages consist of <strong>tags</strong>, often
                        also referred to as <strong>elements</strong>, 
                        which you can consider to be the building blocks of web pages.
                        They are straightforward and easy to learn, even for complete beginners.

                    <h3>HTML5</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>HTML5</strong> is the fifth and last major HTML
                        version that is a World Wide Web
                        Consortium recommendation.<a href="#ref-six"><sup>6</sup></a>
                        HTML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd
                        want to do online without requiring additional software, such
                        as browser plugins. It does everything from animation to apps,
                        music to movies, and can also be used to build complicated
                        applications that run in your browser. It's also
                        cross-platform, meaning it doesn't matter whether you're
                        using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or
                        ultrabook or a Smart TV: if your browser supports HTML5,
                        it should work flawlessly.<a href="#ref-seven"><sup>7</sup></a>
