                        <strong>Hypertext</strong> is text displayed on a
                        computer display or other electronic devices with
                        references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader
                        can immediately access.
                        A <strong>markup language</strong> is a computer language
                        that uses tags to define elements within a document. When
                        the document is processed for display, the markup language
                        is not shown, and is only used to format the text.
                    </aside>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, otherwise
                        known as <b>HTML</b>, is a markup language used to create
                        the content structure of web pages and web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML is <em>not</em> a programming language, meaning
                        it doesnâ€™t have the ability to create dynamic
                        functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to
                        organize and format documents, similarly to 
                        Microsoft Word. HTML allows you to create
                        and structure sections, paragraphs, headings,
                        et cetera. You can view these documents using any
                        web browser, such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla
                        Firefox. The browser reads the HTML file and renders
                        its content so that internet users can view it.
                    </p>

                        The standards and practices for writing HTML are set
                        by the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong>, who
                        constantly publish new versions and updates of HTML. The first ever
                        version of HTML was HTML 1.0 invented by Tim Berners-lee
                        from the CERN research institute, but the first standard
                        version was HTML 2.0, published in 1999.

                    <p>
                        Each HTML page consists of a set of <strong>tags</strong>
                        (also called <strong>elements</strong>), which you can refer
                        to as the building blocks of web pages. They are straightforward
                        and easy to learn, even for complete beginners.

                    <h3>HTML5</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>HTML5</strong> is the fifth and last major HTML
                        version that is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation.
                        HTML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd
                        want to do online without requiring additional software, such
                        as browser plugins. It does everything from animation to apps,
                        music to movies, and can also be used to build complicated
                        applications that run in your browser. It's also
                        cross-platform, meaning it doesn't matter whether you're
                        using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or
                        ultrabook or a Smart TV: if your browser supports HTML5,
                        it should work flawlessly.
